Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn\'t (you can see that from the history), SWITCH to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks "what is my schedule tomorrow", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user\'s question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like "show me ...").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it\'s already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related:\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE in the screenshot and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it\'s opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to "down". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations:\n- Normally to select certain text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don\'t have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nNow output an action from the above list in the correct JSON format, following the reason why you do that. Your answer should look like:\nReason: ...\nAction: {"action_type":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n'}]}], 'max_tokens': 1000}

Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short (better less than 50 words) and in a single line\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don\'t involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: '}]}], 'max_tokens': 1000}

Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn\'t (you can see that from the history), SWITCH to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks "what is my schedule tomorrow", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user\'s question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like "show me ...").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it\'s already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related:\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE in the screenshot and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it\'s opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to "down". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations:\n- Normally to select certain text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don\'t have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nNow output an action from the above list in the correct JSON format, following the reason why you do that. Your answer should look like:\nReason: ...\nAction: {"action_type":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n'}]}], 'max_tokens': 1000}

Some more rules/tips you should follow:\n- Keep it short (better less than 50 words) and in a single line\n- Some actions (like `answer`, `wait`) don\'t involve screen change, you can just assume they work as expected.\n- Given this summary will be added into action history, it can be used as memory to include information that needs to be remembered, or shared between different apps.\n\nSummary of this step: '}]}], 'max_tokens': 1000}

Based on user\'s goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks "What is my schedule for today?".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "complete"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don\'t have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "infeasible"}`\n- Answer user\'s question: `{"action_type": "answer", "text": "<answer_text>"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen. We have added marks (bounding boxes with numeric indexes on their TOP LEFT corner) to most of the UI elements in the screenshot, use the numeric index to indicate which element you want to click: `{"action_type": "click", "index": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on an element on the screen, similar with the click action above, use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate which element you want to long press: `{"action_type": "long_press", "index": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into a text field (this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start), use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate the target text field: `{"action_type": "input_text", "text": <text_input>, "index": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{"action_type": "keyboard_enter"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{"action_type": "navigate_home"}`\n- Navigate back: `{"action_type": "navigate_back"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{"action_type": "scroll", "direction": <up, down, left, right>, "index": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{"action_type": "wait"}`\n\nThe current user goal/request is: Follow the instruction to create a note, the content is: \'Pick up dry cleaning after work.\'\n\nHere is a history of what you have done so far:\nStep 1- Action selected: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}. Summary of this step: Clicked the green circular button with pencil icon to start creating a new note, but the screen changed to an unrelated offer page, indicating the action did not open the note creation interface as expected.\nStep 2- Action selected: {"action_type": "click", "index": 2}.

Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn\'t (you can see that from the history), SWITCH to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks "what is my schedule tomorrow", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user\'s question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like "show me ...").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it\'s already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related:\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE in the screenshot and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it\'s opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to "down". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations:\n- Normally to select certain text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don\'t have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nNow output an action from the above list in the correct JSON format, following the reason why you do that. Your answer should look like:\nReason: ...\nAction: {"action_type":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n'}]}], 'max_tokens': 1000}

Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn\'t (you can see that from the history), SWITCH to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks "what is my schedule tomorrow", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user\'s question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like "show me ...").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it\'s already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related:\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE in the screenshot and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it\'s opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to "down". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations:\n- Normally to select certain text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don\'t have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nNow output an action from the above list in the correct JSON format, following the reason why you do that. Your answer should look like:\nReason: ...\nAction: {"action_type":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n'}]}], 'max_tokens': 1000}

Based on user\'s goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks "What is my schedule for today?".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "complete"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don\'t have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "infeasible"}`\n- Answer user\'s question: `{"action_type": "answer", "text": "<answer_text>"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen. We have added marks (bounding boxes with numeric indexes on their TOP LEFT corner) to most of the UI elements in the screenshot, use the numeric index to indicate which element you want to click: `{"action_type": "click", "index": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on an element on the screen, similar with the click action above, use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate which element you want to long press: `{"action_type": "long_press", "index": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into a text field (this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start), use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate the target text field: `{"action_type": "input_text", "text": <text_input>, "index": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{"action_type": "keyboard_enter"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{"action_type": "navigate_home"}`\n- Navigate back: `{"action_type": "navigate_back"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{"action_type": "scroll", "direction": <up, down, left, right>, "index": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{"action_type": "wait"}`\n\nThe current user goal/request is: Follow the instruction to create a note, the content is: \'Pick up dry cleaning after work.\'\n\nHere is a history of what you have done so far:\nStep 1- Action selected: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}. Summary of this step: Clicked the green circular button with pencil icon to start creating a new note, but the screen changed to an unrelated offer page, indicating the action did not open the note creation interface as expected.\nStep 2- Action selected: {"action_type": "click", "index": 2}.

Based on user\'s goal/request, you may\n- Answer back if the request/goal is a question (or a chat message), like user asks "What is my schedule for today?".\n- Complete some tasks described in the requests/goals by performing actions (step by step) on the phone.\n\nWhen given a user request, you will try to complete it step by step. At each step, you will be given the current screenshot (including the original screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and numeric indexes added to some UI elements) and a history of what you have done (in text). Based on these pieces of information and the goal, you must choose to perform one of the action in the following list (action description followed by the JSON format) by outputing the action in the correct JSON format.\n- If you think the task has been completed, finish the task by using the status action with complete as goal_status: `{"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "complete"}`\n- If you think the task is not feasible (including cases like you don\'t have enough information or can not perform some necessary actions), finish by using the `status` action with infeasible as goal_status: `{"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "infeasible"}`\n- Answer user\'s question: `{"action_type": "answer", "text": "<answer_text>"}`\n- Click/tap on an element on the screen. We have added marks (bounding boxes with numeric indexes on their TOP LEFT corner) to most of the UI elements in the screenshot, use the numeric index to indicate which element you want to click: `{"action_type": "click", "index": <target_index>}`.\n- Long press on an element on the screen, similar with the click action above, use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate which element you want to long press: `{"action_type": "long_press", "index": <target_index>}`.\n- Type text into a text field (this action contains clicking the text field, typing in the text and pressing the enter, so no need to click on the target field to start), use the numeric label on the bounding box to indicate the target text field: `{"action_type": "input_text", "text": <text_input>, "index": <target_index>}`\n- Press the Enter key: `{"action_type": "keyboard_enter"}`\n- Navigate to the home screen: `{"action_type": "navigate_home"}`\n- Navigate back: `{"action_type": "navigate_back"}`\n- Scroll the screen or a scrollable UI element in one of the four directions, use the same numeric index as above if you want to scroll a specific UI element, leave it empty when scroll the whole screen: `{"action_type": "scroll", "direction": <up, down, left, right>, "index": <optional_target_index>}`\n- Open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed): `{"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": <name>}`\n- Wait for the screen to update: `{"action_type": "wait"}`\n\nThe current user goal/request is: Follow the instruction to create a note, the content is: \'Pick up dry cleaning after work.\'\n\nHere is a history of what you have done so far:\nStep 1- Action selected: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}. Summary of this step: Clicked the green circular button with pencil icon to start creating a new note, but the screen changed to an unrelated offer page, indicating the action did not open the note creation interface as expected.\nStep 2- Action selected: {"action_type": "click", "index": 2}. The "START THE TASK" button was clicked to create the note, but it led to a message prompting to install the Calendar Planner app, indicating the current app cannot create notes directly. Further note creation here is not possible without installing that app.\nStep 3- Action selected: {"action_type": "click", "index": 14}. Installed the "Calendar Planner - Agenda App" by clicking the Install button to enable note creation as the current app cannot create notes directly.\n\nThe current screenshot and the same screenshot with bounding boxes and labels added are also given to you.\nHere is a list of detailed information for some of the UI elements (notice that some elements in this list may not be visible in the current screen and so you can not interact with it, can try to scroll the screen to reveal it first), the numeric indexes are consistent with the ones in the labeled screenshot:\nUI element 0: {"index": 0, "is_clickable": False, "is_long_clickable": False, "is_editable": False, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 1: {"index": 1, "is_clickable": False, "is_long_clickable": False, "is_editable": False, "is_scrollable": True, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 2: {"index": 2, "content_description": "Navigate up", "is_clickable": True, "is_long_clickable": False, "is_editable": False, "is_focusable": True, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 3: {"index": 3, "content_description": "Search Google Play", "is_clickable": True, "is_long_clickable": False, "is_editable": False, "is_focusable": True, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 4: {"index": 4, "content_description": "More options", "is_clickable": True, "is_long_clickable": True, "is_editable": False, "is_focusable": True, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 5: {"index": 5, "content_description": "Image of app or game icon for Calendar Planner - Agenda App", "is_clickable": True, "is_long_clickable": False, "is_editable": False, "is_focusable": True, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 6: {"index": 6, "is_clickable": False, "is_long_clickable": False, "is_editable": False, "is_scrollable": True, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 7: {"index": 7, "content_description": "About this app\n", "is_clickable": True, "is_long_clickable": False, "is_editable": False, "is_focusable": True, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 8: {"index": 8, "text": "A daily calendar planner, schedule agenda 2024 with calender widgets, memo app", "is_clickable": False, "is_long_clickable": False, "is_editable": False, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 9: {"index": 9, "content_description": "Data safety\n", "is_clickable": True, "is_long_clickable": False, "is_editable": False, "is_focusable": True, "is_selected": False, "is_checked": False}\nUI element 10: {"index": 10, "text": "Safety starts with understanding how developers collect and share your data.

Also when something does not work as expected (due to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem, but if it doesn\'t (you can see that from the history), SWITCH to other solutions.\n- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information needed to complete the task, for example if user asks "what is my schedule tomorrow", then you may want to open the calendar app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer user\'s question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish! Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless the goal is something like "show me ...").\n- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when it\'s already on), you can just complete the task.\nAction Related:\n- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you pick must be VISIBLE in the screenshot and also in the UI element list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on the screen so you can not interact with them).\n- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing sometimes as it\'s opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to "down". It has been observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\nText Related Operations:\n- Normally to select certain text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc. <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n- At this point, you don\'t have the ability to drag something around the screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button in the keyboard.\n- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.\n- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.\n- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one in the list.\n\nNow output an action from the above list in the correct JSON format, following the reason why you do that. Your answer should look like:\nReason: ...\nAction: {"action_type":...}\n\nYour Answer:\n'}]}], 'max_tokens': 1000}
