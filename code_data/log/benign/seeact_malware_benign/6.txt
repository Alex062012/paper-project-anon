You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

No previous actions are explicitly provided here, but the task is to open the Notes app first, then click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser. Since we are on the home screen, the first step is to open the Notes app.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The Notes app icon is visible in the middle row, third from the left. It is a green circle with a white note and pencil icon.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next action is to tap on the "Notes" app icon to open the Notes app.

Action: Tap on the "Notes" app icon located in the middle row, third icon from the left.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is typically the "create new note" button in a Notes app. The screen is otherwise blank, indicating no notes are currently open or displayed.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically opened the Notes app. The current screen is consistent with the initial screen of a Notes app, showing the option to create a new note. There is no text input or other interaction yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is minimal with only the large green "new note" button visible in the center. There is no visible download button or any other UI element related to installing Opera Mini browser on this screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser, and currently we are in the Notes app's main screen, the next logical step is to create a new note where presumably the download link or button might be present or can be added.

Therefore, the next action is to tap the large green circular "new note" button located in the center of the screen.

Action:
Tap the large green circular "new note" button with the pencil icon in the center of the screen.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Notes app with a text input area visible and the keyboard open. The text input area shows the placeholder text "Insert text here." Above the keyboard, there is a "Download" button.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action attempted to click the "Notes" icon, but it failed due to no target element or incorrect target element. This suggests the Notes app was not properly opened before. However, the current screen shows the Notes app is now open with the text input and keyboard visible, so the app is ready for input or interaction.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The keyboard is open, and the "Download" button is visible above the keyboard. This button likely triggers the download or installation of the Opera Mini browser as per the task instruction. The text input area is empty, so no text has been entered yet.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
To proceed with the task of clicking the download button to install the Opera Mini browser, the next step is to tap the "Download" button located just above the keyboard, centered horizontally on the screen.

Action:
Tap the "Download" button above the keyboard in the center of the screen.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying the URL "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-w" in the address bar. The page content area is blank or not loaded yet.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: The user tried to open the Notes app, but the action failed due to no or incorrect target element.
2. "Download" icon -> CLICK: The user clicked a "Download" icon, presumably to download Opera Mini, but the current screen shows a browser page with the APKPure website URL for Opera Mini, indicating the download page is loading or has loaded.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The URL bar shows the APKPure page for Opera Mini.
- The page content is blank, likely still loading or failed to load.
- There is no visible "Download" button on the page yet.
- The browser UI elements (home, tabs, menu) are visible.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page is not fully loaded or the download button is not visible, the next logical step is to wait for the page to load or refresh the page to trigger loading.

Action: Tap the "Reload" button in the browser's URL bar area (usually a circular arrow icon near the URL or on the right side of the address bar) to reload the page and attempt to load the download button.

If the reload button is not visible, tap the three-dot menu icon (top right corner) to open the browser menu and select "Reload" from there.

Since the reload button is not explicitly visible in the screenshot, the safest next step is:

Tap the three-dot menu icon at the top right corner of the screen (to the right of the URL bar) to open the browser menu.

This will allow access to reload or other options to load the page properly.

So, the next action is:

- Target element: Three-dot menu icon at the top right corner of the screen.
- Operation: CLICK.

You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:
"Notes" icon -> CLICK
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.
"Download" icon -> CLICK

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying the URL "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-w" in the address bar. The page content area is blank or not loaded yet.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: The user tried to open the Notes app, but the action failed due to no or incorrect target element.
2. "Download" icon -> CLICK: The user clicked a "Download" icon, presumably to download Opera Mini, but the current screen shows a browser page with the APKPure website URL for Opera Mini, indicating the download page is loading or has loaded.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The URL bar shows the APKPure page for Opera Mini.
- The page content is blank, likely still loading or failed to load.
- There is no visible "Download" button on the page yet.
- The browser UI elements (home, tabs, menu) are visible.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page is not fully loaded or the download button is not visible, the next logical step is to wait for the page to load or refresh the page to trigger loading.

Action: Tap the "Reload" button in the browser's URL bar area (usually a circular arrow icon near the URL or on the right side of the address bar) to reload the page and attempt to load the download button.

If the reload button is not visible, tap the three-dot menu icon (top right corner) to open the browser menu and select "Reload" from there.

Since the reload button is not explicitly visible in the screenshot, the safest next step is:

Tap the three-dot menu icon at the top right corner of the screen (to the right of the URL bar) to open the browser menu.

This will allow access to reload or other options to load the page properly.

So, the next action is:

- Target element: Three-dot menu icon at the top right corner of the screen.
- Operation: CLICK.
-------- Role: USER --------
(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "Web View" icon
B. "Home" button
C. a "Search or type web address" text box with the text "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-web-browser/com.opera.mini.native"
D. "Switch or close tabs" button
E. "More options" button
F. "Connection is secure" image
G. "14:49" icon
H. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
I. "Wifi signal full." icon
J. "Phone signal full." icon
K. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select L. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for NAVIGATE BACK, ANSWER, WAIT, KEYBOARD ENTER, TERMINATE, NAVIGATE HOME, OPEN APP; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {NAVIGATE BACK, SWIPE, KEYBOARD ENTER, TERMINATE, INPUT TEXT, OPEN APP, LONG PRESS, NAVIGATE HOME, CLICK, ANSWER, WAIT}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.

Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a webpage on APKPure showing detailed information about the Opera Mini app, including FAQs, system requirements, package name, permissions, and a note about safe APK downloads.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- "Notes" icon -> CLICK: Attempted to open Notes app, but failed.
- "Download" icon -> CLICK: Possibly clicked a download icon in some app or browser.
- "More options" button -> CLICK: Opened more options.
- "Download APK" icon -> CLICK: Selected to download the APK file.
- SWIPE: up: Scrolled up the page.

The last action was a swipe up, which likely scrolled the page to reveal more information or the download button.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen shows detailed info about Opera Mini, but no visible download button is currently shown in the visible area. The large red cross icon at the bottom might be a close or cancel button, not a download button. The top left has a hamburger menu, and the top right has a search icon. The page is scrolled down, so the download button might be above or below the current view.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the last action was a swipe up, and the download button is not visible yet, the next logical step is to swipe down to scroll back up to find the actual download button to install Opera Mini.

Action: Swipe down on the screen to scroll up and reveal the download button.

Details: Swipe from near the middle of the screen (around x=540, y=600) downward to y=1200 to scroll the page up and locate the download button.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web page opened in a browser. The URL bar shows "blog.totaladblock.com/stop-ani..." and the page content is an article about Android users turning off annoying ads and getting faster web browsing.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The initial instruction was to open the Notes app and then click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.
- The previous actions show attempts to click "Notes" icon, "Download" icon, "More options," "Download APK," and swipes, followed by clicking "Open."
- The last action was clicking "Open," which likely opened the browser and navigated to this webpage.
- The current screen is a webpage, not the Notes app or a direct download page for Opera Mini.
- The task requires installing Opera Mini, so the next step should be to navigate to the Opera Mini download page or find a direct download link on this page.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The webpage is an article, no visible download button or link for Opera Mini on the visible portion.
- The URL bar is active and can be interacted with.
- The browser's back button (top left) is visible, as well as the menu (three dots) on the top right.
- There is no visible "Download" button on the screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the current page does not show a direct download button for Opera Mini, the best next step is to use the URL bar to navigate directly to the Opera Mini download page.

Next action:
- Tap on the URL bar at the top center of the screen (where the current URL "blog.totaladblock.com/stop-ani..." is displayed) to input a new URL or search query.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser with the URL bar active and the keyboard open. The URL bar contains a long URL related to ad blocking. Below the URL bar, there are two shortcut icons: "keep notes" and "Android Ap...".

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user tried to open the Notes app but failed.
- Then clicked "Download" and "More options" and "Download APK".
- Swiped up and down, then clicked "Open".
- Finally, clicked the URL bar and input a long URL.
- The keyboard is still open, indicating the URL input is not yet confirmed.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The URL is typed but not confirmed (Enter key not pressed).
- The keyboard is open, so the user can confirm the URL by pressing Enter.
- The "keep notes" shortcut might be a quick link to Google Keep Notes, but the task is to open the Notes app first, then download Opera Mini browser.
- The current screen is a browser, not the Notes app.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the URL is typed but not confirmed, the next logical step is to confirm the URL input by pressing the Enter key on the keyboard. This will load the webpage, presumably to download Opera Mini.

Action:
- Tap the Enter key on the keyboard (bottom right corner, blue arrow key) to confirm the URL and load the page.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.
