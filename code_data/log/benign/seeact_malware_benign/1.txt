You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

The previous actions are not explicitly provided here, but the current screen is the home screen, indicating that any previous app or action has been exited or completed. The task is to open the Notes app first.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The Notes app icon is visible on the home screen, located in the top row, third icon from the left. It is a green circle with a white note and pencil symbol.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
To proceed with the task, the next step is to open the Notes app.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is typically the "create new note" button in a Notes app. The rest of the screen is mostly blank, indicating no notes are currently open or displayed.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which likely opened the Notes app. Now, the app is showing the main screen with the option to create a new note. There is no indication that any text input or other action has been done yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is ready for the user to create a new note by tapping the green circular icon in the center. There are no other visible buttons or options related to downloading or installing apps on this screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to open the Notes app and then click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser, and currently we are in the Notes app main screen, the next logical step is to create a new note where presumably the download link or button for Opera Mini might be entered or accessed.

Next action:
- Tap the large green circular "create new note" button located in the center of the screen. This is the first next target element to proceed further in the Notes app.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying the URL "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-w" in the address bar. The page content is not fully loaded or is blank.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The first action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target element or incorrect target element.
- The second action was clicking the "Download" icon, which presumably opened the browser to the APKPure page for Opera Mini.
- The current screen shows the browser with the Opera Mini download page URL but no visible download button or content yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The page content is blank, indicating the page has not loaded or is stuck.
- The URL is correct for downloading Opera Mini.
- The browser controls (home, tabs, menu) are visible.
- No download button or other interactive elements are visible on the page.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page is blank and the download button is not visible, the next logical step is to refresh the page to attempt loading the content properly.

Next action:
Tap the "Reload" button in the browser's address bar area, which is typically located near the URL or on the right side of the address bar (usually a circular arrow icon). This will reload the page and hopefully display the download button for Opera Mini.

Action: CLICK on the "Reload" button in the browser's address bar at the top right area of the screen.

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying the URL "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-w" in the address bar. The page content is not fully loaded or is blank.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The first action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target element or incorrect target element.
- The second action was clicking the "Download" icon, which presumably opened the browser to the APKPure page for Opera Mini.
- The current screen shows the browser with the Opera Mini download page URL but no visible download button or content yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The page content is blank, indicating the page has not loaded or is stuck.
- The URL is correct for downloading Opera Mini.
- The browser controls (home, tabs, menu) are visible.
- No download button or other interactive elements are visible on the page.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page is blank and the download button is not visible, the next logical step is to refresh the page to attempt loading the content properly.

Next action:
Tap the "Reload" button in the browser's address bar area, which is typically located near the URL or on the right side of the address bar (usually a circular arrow icon). This will reload the page and hopefully display the download button for Opera Mini.

Action: CLICK on the "Reload" button in the browser's address bar at the top right area of the screen.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "Web View" icon
B. "Home" button
C. a "Search or type web address" text box with the text "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-web-browser/com.opera.mini.native"
D. "Switch or close tabs" button
E. "More options" button
F. "Your connection to this site is not secure" image
G. "14:38" icon
H. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
I. "Wifi signal full." icon
J. "Phone signal full." icon
K. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select L. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for TERMINATE, OPEN APP, ANSWER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, KEYBOARD ENTER; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {CLICK, ANSWER, OPEN APP, WAIT, SWIPE, LONG PRESS, NAVIGATE HOME, INPUT TEXT, NAVIGATE BACK, TERMINATE, KEYBOARD ENTER}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".

- The first previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target element or incorrect target.
- The second previous action was clicking the "Download" icon, which also failed for the same reason.
- The current screen shows the Opera Mini app page on a browser, indicating the user has navigated to the download page for Opera Mini.
- The instruction is to open the Notes app first, then click the download button to install Opera Mini.
- Since the Notes app was not successfully opened, and the current screen is a browser page for downloading Opera Mini, the next step should be to open the Notes app first.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The screen is a browser page, not the Notes app.
- The "Download APK" button is visible but the instruction requires opening the Notes app first.
- The "Notes" app icon should be on the home screen or app drawer.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

The current screen is a webpage on apkpure.com showing the details of the Opera Mini: Fast Web Browser app, including its size, number of downloads, update date, and a "Trusted App" badge. This is the app's download page.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user tried to open the Notes app and click a download button but failed.
- The user navigated home and tried again to open Notes and click Download but failed.
- The user then clicked "Download APK" icon, which likely led to this current page on apkpure.com for Opera Mini.
- The current screen shows the Opera Mini app page, so the user is now at the right place to download the app.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The page shows the Opera Mini app details.
- The top left has a back arrow icon (to go back).
- The top right has a tab icon with "2" and a three-dot menu.
- The page does not yet show a visible "Download" button, but it is likely below the visible area or accessible by scrolling.
- The bottom right has a red circular button with a share icon.
- The page is scrollable (indicated by the scroll bar on the right).

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the "Download" button is not visible on the current screen, the next logical step is to scroll down to reveal the "Download" button.

Action:
Swipe up on the screen from near the bottom center to near the top center to scroll down and reveal the "Download" button for Opera Mini.

You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

"Download" icon -> CLICK
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.
