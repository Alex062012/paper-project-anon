You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is typically the "create new note" button in a Notes app. The rest of the screen is mostly blank, indicating no notes are currently open or displayed.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically opened the Notes app. The current screen is consistent with the Notes app's main or empty state screen, showing the option to create a new note. No text input or other actions have been done yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is ready for the user to create a new note by tapping the green circular icon in the center. There is no visible download button or any direct link to install Opera Mini browser on this screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to open the Notes app and then click the download button to install Opera Mini browser, the next logical step is to create a new note where presumably the user will input or access the download link or instructions.

Next action:
Tap the large green circular "create new note" button in the center of the screen. This is the first next target element to proceed with the task.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying the URL "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-w" in the address bar. The page content area is currently blank or not loaded.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The first action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target or incorrect target element.
- The second action was clicking the "Download" icon, which presumably opened the browser to the APKPure page for Opera Mini.
- The current screen shows the browser with the Opera Mini download page URL, but the page content is not loaded or visible.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The browser is open with the correct URL for downloading Opera Mini.
- The page content is blank, indicating the page might not have loaded properly.
- There is no visible "Download" button on the page currently.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page content is not loaded, the next step is to refresh or reload the page to load the download button.

Action: Tap the "Reload" button in the browser.
Location: The "Reload" button is typically located near the address bar, often represented by a circular arrow icon. In this screenshot, it is not explicitly visible, but the three-dot menu icon is visible on the right side of the address bar.

If no explicit reload button is visible, tap the three-dot menu icon (top right corner) to open the browser menu, then select "Reload" from the menu.

Therefore, the next action is:

Tap the three-dot menu icon at the top right corner of the browser screen to open the menu for reloading the page.

Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying the URL "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-w" in the address bar. The page content area is currently blank or not loaded.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The first action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target or incorrect target element.
- The second action was clicking the "Download" icon, which presumably opened the browser to the APKPure page for Opera Mini.
- The current screen shows the browser with the Opera Mini download page URL, but the page content is not loaded or visible.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The browser is open with the correct URL for downloading Opera Mini.
- The page content is blank, indicating the page might not have loaded properly.
- There is no visible "Download" button on the page currently.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page content is not loaded, the next step is to refresh or reload the page to load the download button.

Action: Tap the "Reload" button in the browser.
Location: The "Reload" button is typically located near the address bar, often represented by a circular arrow icon. In this screenshot, it is not explicitly visible, but the three-dot menu icon is visible on the right side of the address bar.

If no explicit reload button is visible, tap the three-dot menu icon (top right corner) to open the browser menu, then select "Reload" from the menu.

Therefore, the next action is:

Tap the three-dot menu icon at the top right corner of the browser screen to open the menu for reloading the page.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "Web View" icon
B. "Home" button
C. a "Search or type web address" text box with the text "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-web-browser/com.opera.mini.native"
D. "Switch or close tabs" button
E. "More options" button
F. "Your connection to this site is not secure" image
G. "14:52" icon
H. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
I. "Wifi signal full." icon
J. "Phone two bars." icon
K. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select L. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for TERMINATE, NAVIGATE BACK, ANSWER, WAIT, OPEN APP, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {TERMINATE, NAVIGATE BACK, SWIPE, INPUT TEXT, LONG PRESS, CLICK, KEYBOARD ENTER, WAIT, OPEN APP, ANSWER, NAVIGATE HOME}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.

You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:

No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.
"Download" icon -> CLICK

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web page opened in a browser. The URL is "blog.totaladblock.com/stop-ani..." and the page content is about Android users turning off annoying ads and getting faster web browsing. The browser UI is visible with a home button, URL bar, tab count (8), and menu button.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- "Notes" icon -> CLICK: Tried to open Notes app but failed (error).
- "Download" icon -> CLICK: Attempted to download something.
- "More options" button -> CLICK: Opened more options.
- "Download APK" icon -> CLICK: Selected to download an APK file.
- "Download" icon -> SWIPE: up: Scrolled up on the download page.
- "Open" icon -> CLICK: Opened the downloaded file or link.

The last action "Open" icon -> CLICK likely opened the browser and navigated to the page shown in the screenshot.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen shows a browser page, not the Notes app or an installation prompt for Opera Mini. The task is to open the Notes app and click the download button to install Opera Mini browser. The current screen is unrelated to Notes or the Opera Mini download button.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the current screen is a browser page unrelated to the task, the next step should be to return to the home screen or app drawer to open the Notes app as originally instructed.

Next action:
- Tap the "Home" button at the bottom center of the screen to exit the browser and return to the home screen.

This will allow the user to then locate and open the Notes app as per the task instructions.

The visible app icons include Play Store, Gmail, Notes, Contacts, Phone, Messages, Chrome, and a shortcut to Notes again. There is also a Google search bar at the bottom.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The initial instruction was to open the Notes app.
- The first action attempted to click the "Notes" icon but failed due to no or incorrect target element.
- Then, a series of actions related to downloading were performed: clicking "Download" icon, "More options," "Download APK," swiping up on "Download," clicking "Open," and finally navigating home.
- The last action was "NAVIGATE HOME," which brought us to the current home screen.
- The task is to open the Notes app and then click the download button to install Opera Mini browser.
- Since we are now on the home screen, the next logical step is to open the Notes app again.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The Notes app icon is visible on the home screen, located in the top row, third icon from the left.
- The icon is green with a white note and pencil symbol.
- The previous attempt to open Notes failed, so this time we should try clicking the Notes icon again.

~~~~~~~~~ANSWER~~~~~~~~~:"Notes" icon -> CLICK


================================================================================
-------- Role: SYSTEM --------
-------- Role: USER --------
You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:
"Notes" icon -> CLICK
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.
"Download" icon -> CLICK
"More options" button -> CLICK
"Download APK" icon -> CLICK
"Download" icon -> SWIPE: up
"Open" icon -> CLICK
NAVIGATE HOME
"Notes" icon -> CLICK

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Notes app with a blank note open. The keyboard is visible, and the text input area shows the placeholder "Insert text here." There is a "Download" button above the keyboard.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user has already navigated to the Notes app.
- The previous actions involved attempts to download and open the Opera Mini browser APK, but the current screen shows the Notes app with an active text input and a "Download" button.
- The last action was clicking the "Notes" icon to open the Notes app again.
- The "Download" button visible here is likely part of the note content or a custom button in the note, not the system download button for installing apps.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The keyboard is active, indicating the text input is focused.
- The "Download" button is visible above the keyboard, likely part of the note interface.
- There is no visible system prompt or app installation screen.
- The "More options" (three dots) button is visible in the top right corner.
- The user needs to install the Opera Mini browser, which typically requires opening the downloaded APK file from the Downloads app or file manager, not from within Notes.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the user is currently in the Notes app and the task is to install the Opera Mini browser, the next logical step is to exit the Notes app and open the "Files" or "Downloads" app to locate the downloaded Opera Mini APK for installation.

Therefore, the next action is:

- Tap the Home button to exit the Notes app and return to the home screen.

This will allow the user to then open the Downloads or Files app to proceed with the installation.

First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.
