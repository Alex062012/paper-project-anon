You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is typically the "create new note" button in a Notes app. The rest of the screen is blank, indicating no notes are currently displayed or the app is waiting for user input to create a new note.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which opened the Notes app. The current screen confirms that the Notes app is open but no note is created or selected yet. Since the task is to open the Notes app and then click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser, the next step should be to find a way to access the download button or a link to install Opera Mini. However, the Notes app itself typically does not have a direct download button for browsers.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen only shows the new note creation icon, no other buttons or links are visible. This suggests that the Notes app is empty or at its main screen. There is no visible download button here.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to click the download button to install Opera Mini browser, and the Notes app does not show any such button, the next logical step is to tap the large green circular icon in the center of the screen to create a new note. Possibly, the note will contain a link or instructions related to downloading Opera Mini, or the user might input or access the download button from there.

Action:
Tap the large green circular "create new note" button located in the center of the screen.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying the URL "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-w" in the address bar. The page content area is currently blank or not loaded.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. The first action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target element or incorrect target element.
2. The second action was clicking the "Download" icon, which presumably opened the browser to the APKPure page for Opera Mini.
3. The current screen shows the browser with the Opera Mini download page URL, but the page content is not loaded or visible.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The browser is open with the correct URL for downloading Opera Mini.
- The page content is blank, indicating the page has not loaded or is stuck.
- There is no visible "Download" button on the screen to click.
- The URL bar is active and visible at the top.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page content is blank, the next logical step is to refresh or reload the page to load the download page content properly.

Action: Tap the "Reload" button in the browser.
Location: The circular arrow icon to the right of the URL bar (usually near the right side of the address bar).

This will attempt to reload the page so the download button can appear and be clicked next.

Previous Actions:
"Notes" icon -> CLICK
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.
"Download" icon -> CLICK

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying the URL "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-w" in the address bar. The page content area is currently blank or not loaded.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. The first action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target element or incorrect target element.
2. The second action was clicking the "Download" icon, which presumably opened the browser to the APKPure page for Opera Mini.
3. The current screen shows the browser with the Opera Mini download page URL, but the page content is not loaded or visible.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The browser is open with the correct URL for downloading Opera Mini.
- The page content is blank, indicating the page has not loaded or is stuck.
- There is no visible "Download" button on the screen to click.
- The URL bar is active and visible at the top.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page content is blank, the next logical step is to refresh or reload the page to load the download page content properly.

Action: Tap the "Reload" button in the browser.
Location: The circular arrow icon to the right of the URL bar (usually near the right side of the address bar).

This will attempt to reload the page so the download button can appear and be clicked next.
-------- Role: USER --------
(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "Web View" icon
B. "Home" button
C. a "Search or type web address" text box with the text "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-web-browser/com.opera.mini.native"
D. "Switch or close tabs" button
E. "More options" button
F. "Your connection to this site is not secure" image
G. "14:59" icon
H. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
I. "Wifi signal full." icon
J. "Phone signal full." icon
K. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select L. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for TERMINATE, OPEN APP, WAIT, ANSWER, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {INPUT TEXT, OPEN APP, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE BACK, CLICK, SWIPE, TERMINATE, WAIT, ANSWER, LONG PRESS, NAVIGATE HOME}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".

You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:
"Notes" icon -> CLICK
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.
"Download" icon -> CLICK

No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:
"Notes" icon -> CLICK
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.
"Download" icon -> CLICK
a "Search or type web address" text box with the text "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-web-browser/com.opera.mini.native" -> CLICK
KEYBOARD ENTER
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

- Then clicked the "Download" icon and entered the URL "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-web-browser/com.opera.mini.native" in the browser's address bar.
- The user attempted to press Enter but it failed.
- The user clicked "Download APK" and closed an ad.
- The user swiped up to see more content.

First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.
