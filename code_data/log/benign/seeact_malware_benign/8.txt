You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is typically the "create new note" button in a Notes app. The screen is otherwise blank, indicating no notes are currently open or displayed.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically opened the Notes app. The current screen is consistent with the Notes app's main or empty state screen, showing the option to create a new note.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
There are no other visible buttons or options on this screen except the large green "create new note" button in the center. There is no visible download button or any indication of a link to install Opera Mini browser here.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser, and currently we are in the Notes app with no visible download button, the next logical step is to tap the large green "create new note" button in the center of the screen. This might open a note where the download link or button for Opera Mini is written or accessible.

Action:
Tap the large green circular button with the pencil icon located in the center of the screen.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying a page from apkpure.com for the Opera Mini browser. However, the page content is not loaded yet; it is blank except for the URL bar and browser UI.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: The user tried to open the Notes app, but it failed (no target element or incorrect target).
2. "Download" icon -> CLICK: The user clicked a "Download" icon, which likely opened the browser to the Opera Mini download page on apkpure.com.

The last action brought us to this browser page, but the page content is not loaded yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The URL bar shows the correct URL for Opera Mini on apkpure.com.
- The page content area is blank, indicating the page is still loading or failed to load.
- The browser UI is visible with back, home, and tabs buttons.
- No visible "Download" button on the page yet.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page content is not loaded, the next step is to refresh the page to try to load the download page properly.

Action: Tap the "Reload" button in the browser's URL bar area (usually a circular arrow icon near the URL or on the right side of the address bar).

If the reload button is not visible, tap the three-dot menu (top right corner) to find a "Reload" option.

This will attempt to load the page so the download button can appear for the next step.

Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web browser displaying a page from apkpure.com for the Opera Mini browser. However, the page content is not loaded yet; it is blank except for the URL bar and browser UI.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: The user tried to open the Notes app, but it failed (no target element or incorrect target).
2. "Download" icon -> CLICK: The user clicked a "Download" icon, which likely opened the browser to the Opera Mini download page on apkpure.com.

The last action brought us to this browser page, but the page content is not loaded yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The URL bar shows the correct URL for Opera Mini on apkpure.com.
- The page content area is blank, indicating the page is still loading or failed to load.
- The browser UI is visible with back, home, and tabs buttons.
- No visible "Download" button on the page yet.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the page content is not loaded, the next step is to refresh the page to try to load the download page properly.

Action: Tap the "Reload" button in the browser's URL bar area (usually a circular arrow icon near the URL or on the right side of the address bar).

If the reload button is not visible, tap the three-dot menu (top right corner) to find a "Reload" option.

This will attempt to load the page so the download button can appear for the next step.

First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "Web View" icon
B. "Home" button
C. a "Search or type web address" text box with the text "apkpure.com/opera-mini-fast-web-browser/com.opera.mini.native"
D. "Switch or close tabs" button
E. "More options" button
F. "Connection is secure" image
G. "14:54" icon
H. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
I. "Wifi signal full." icon
J. "Phone signal full." icon
K. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select L. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for OPEN APP, WAIT, ANSWER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, KEYBOARD ENTER, TERMINATE; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {OPEN APP, INPUT TEXT, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, CLICK, SWIPE, WAIT, ANSWER, TERMINATE}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a webpage on apkpure.com showing the Opera Mini app details with an option to download the APK file. The URL bar confirms this is a browser view, not the Notes app.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The first previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target element or incorrect target.
- The second previous action was clicking the "Download" icon, which also failed for the same reason.
- These failures suggest the system did not successfully open the Notes app or find the download button within it.
- Instead, the current screen shows a browser page for downloading Opera Mini, indicating the user or system has navigated outside the Notes app to a browser.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The screen shows the Opera Mini app page on apkpure.com.
- The green "Download APK" button is visible near the bottom center of the screen.
- This button is the correct element to initiate the download/install of Opera Mini.
- There is no visible Notes app interface here, so the instruction to open Notes app and then click download cannot be followed literally at this moment.
- Since the current screen is the Opera Mini download page, the next logical step is to tap the "Download APK" button to start the installation.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
- Tap the green "Download APK" button located near the bottom center of the screen, just above the "How to install XAPK / APK file" link.
- This action will initiate the download of the Opera Mini browser APK.

Action: CLICK on the green "Download APK" button near the bottom center of the screen.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a webpage on apkpure.com showing the Opera Mini app details, including the app name, version, size, downloads, and update date. This is the app's download page.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user tried to open the Notes app but failed.
- Then tried clicking "Download" and "Download APK" icons but failed.
- The last action was clicking "Download APK," which likely led to this current page showing the Opera Mini app details.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The page shows the Opera Mini app details but no visible "Download" button on the visible portion of the screen.
- The top left has a hamburger menu icon, and the top right has a search icon and a three-dot menu.
- The page likely requires scrolling down to reveal the actual download button.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a webpage on APKPure showing detailed information about the Opera Mini app, including FAQs, system requirements, package name, permissions, and other metadata. This is likely the app's download page.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user tried to open the Notes app but failed.
- Then tried clicking "Download" and "Download APK" icons, but no successful operation was recorded.
- The last action was a swipe up, presumably to scroll down the page to find the download button.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The screen shows detailed info about Opera Mini.
- The download button is not visible in the current view.
- The page is scrollable, and the download button is likely below the current view.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
To find and click the download button, the next step is to swipe up further to reveal the download button.

Action: SWIPE up on the screen to scroll down and reveal the download button.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:
"Notes" icon -> CLICK
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.
"Download" icon -> CLICK

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.
