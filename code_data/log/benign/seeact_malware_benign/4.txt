You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is typically the "create new note" button in a Notes app. The screen is otherwise blank, indicating no notes are currently open or displayed.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically opened the Notes app. The current screen is consistent with the Notes app's main or empty state screen, showing the option to create a new note.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
There are no other visible UI elements or buttons on the screen except the large green "new note" button in the center. There is no visible download button or any indication of a link to install Opera Mini browser here.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to click the download button to install the Opera Mini browser, and we are currently in the Notes app with no visible download button, the next logical step is to create a new note where presumably the download link or button might be present or can be added.

Therefore, the next action is to tap the large green circular "new note" button located in the center of the screen.

Action:
Tap the large green circular button with the pencil icon in the center of the screen to create a new note.

Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is a web page on apkpure.com showing the Opera Mini Fast Web Browser app details with a notification at the top indicating that the file has been downloaded (34.17 MB). There is a green "Download APK" button visible, but the file is already downloaded.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The first previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target element or incorrect target element.
- The second previous action was clicking the "Download" icon, which presumably led to this APKPure page for Opera Mini.
- The file has now been downloaded as indicated by the notification.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The file download is complete.
- The "Download APK" button is still visible but not necessary to click again since the file is downloaded.
- The next logical step to install the Opera Mini browser is to open the downloaded file.
- There is an "Open" button in the download notification at the top of the screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Tap the "Open" button in the download notification at the top of the screen to start the installation of the Opera Mini browser APK.

The current screen is the "Downloads" screen of the Android device, showing a list of downloaded files. The top shows storage usage, and there are filter buttons for "All," "Pages," and "Other." The list includes files related to Opera Mini and APKPure. At the bottom, there is a message "Can't open file," indicating an attempt to open a file failed.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- "Notes" icon -> CLICK: Attempted to open the Notes app, but it failed (error).
- "Download" icon -> CLICK: Likely switched to the Downloads app or screen.
- "Open" button -> CLICK: Tried to open a downloaded file, but the "Can't open file" message suggests the file could not be opened.

The last action was trying to open a file, but it failed. The task is to install Opera Mini browser by clicking the download button in Notes app, but since Notes app failed to open, the user went to Downloads to manually open the Opera Mini APK file.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The file "Opera Mini_Fast Web Browser_94.0.22..." is present and likely the APK to install.
- The "Can't open file" message suggests the system cannot open the file directly from here.
- There is a three-dot menu icon next to the Opera Mini file, which might provide options like "Install" or "Open with."
- The top right has a gear icon (settings), search, and close (X) icons.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
To proceed with installing Opera Mini, the user should try to install the APK file from the Downloads list. Since direct open failed, the next best step is to tap the three-dot menu icon next to the "Opera Mini_Fast Web Browser_94.0.22..." file to see if there is an "Install" option.

Action:
Tap the three-dot menu icon located to the right of the "Opera Mini_Fast Web Browser_94.0.22..." file entry, which is near the top of the list under "Just now." This will open a context menu with options related to the file, likely including "Install."

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the "Downloads" screen, showing a list of downloaded files. The top file is "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." which appears to be the Opera Mini browser APK file. There is also a context menu open for the third file ("APKPure_v3.20.5102_apkpure.com.apk") with options: Share, Rename, Delete.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user tried to open the "Notes" app but got an error.
- Then clicked the "Download" icon, then "Open" button, and "More options" button, but the last "More options" click failed.
- The current screen shows the Downloads list, so the user has navigated to the Downloads app or screen.
- The task is to install Opera Mini browser by clicking the download button in Notes app, but since Notes app was not successfully opened, the user seems to have moved to Downloads to open the Opera Mini APK directly.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The Opera Mini APK file is visible at the top of the list.
- The context menu is open for a different file (third file), not the Opera Mini APK.
- The "Open" button or install button for the Opera Mini APK is not visible yet.
- The user needs to tap the Opera Mini APK file to trigger the installation prompt.

No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

The current screen is the "Downloads" screen, showing a list of downloaded files. The top file is "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." which appears to be the Opera Mini browser APK file. There is also a context menu open for the third file ("APKPure_v3.20.5102_apkpure.com.apk") with options: Share, Rename, Delete.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user tried to open the "Notes" app but got an error.
- Then clicked the "Download" icon, then "Open" button, and "More options" button, but the last "More options" click failed.
- The current screen shows the Downloads list, so the user has navigated to the Downloads app or screen.
- The task is to install Opera Mini browser by clicking the download button in Notes app, but since Notes app was not successfully opened, the user seems to have moved to Downloads to open the Opera Mini APK directly.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The Opera Mini APK file is visible at the top of the list.
- The context menu is open for a different file (third file), not the Opera Mini APK.
- The "Open" button or install button for the Opera Mini APK is not visible yet.
- The user needs to tap the Opera Mini APK file to trigger the installation prompt.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to tap on the "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." file (the first file in the list) to open it and start the installation process.

Action: Tap on the first file in the list named "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." located just below the "Just now" label, on the left side where the file icon and name are displayed. This will initiate the installation of the Opera Mini browser.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "Share" icon
B. "Rename" icon
C. "Delete" icon
D. "14:46" icon
E. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
F. "Wifi signal full." icon
G. "Phone one bar." icon
H. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select I. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the "Downloads" app or section, showing a list of downloaded files. The top file is "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." which appears to be the Opera Mini browser APK file.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user tried to open the "Notes" app but got an error.
- Then clicked the "Download" icon and "Open" button, likely to open the Downloads app.
- Tried clicking "More options" but got errors.
- The current screen shows the downloaded Opera Mini APK file, with a context menu open for the third file (options: Share, Rename, Delete).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The context menu is open for the third file "APKPure_v3.20.5102_apkpure.com.apk".
- The target is to install the Opera Mini browser, so the user should open the Opera Mini APK file.
- The context menu for the third file is blocking the screen; it should be dismissed first.
- The first file "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." is the likely APK to install.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to dismiss the context menu by tapping outside it, then tap the first file "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." to start the installation.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the "Downloads" app or section, showing a list of downloaded files. The top file is "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." which appears to be the Opera Mini browser APK file.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user tried to open the "Notes" app but got an error.
- Then clicked the "Download" icon and "Open" button, likely to open the Downloads app.
- Tried clicking "More options" but got errors.
- The current screen shows the downloaded Opera Mini APK file, with a context menu open for the third file (options: Share, Rename, Delete).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The context menu is open for the third file "APKPure_v3.20.5102_apkpure.com.apk".
- The target is to install the Opera Mini browser, so the user should open the Opera Mini APK file.
- The context menu for the third file is blocking the screen; it should be dismissed first.
- The first file "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." is the likely APK to install.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to dismiss the context menu by tapping outside it, then tap the first file "Opera Mini_Fast Web B..." to start the installation.

Action:
Tap on the blank area below the list (bottom center of the screen) to dismiss the context menu.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "Share" icon
B. "Rename" icon
C. "Delete" icon
D. "14:47" icon
E. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
F. "Wifi signal full." icon
G. "Phone signal full." icon
H. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select I. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for WAIT, OPEN APP, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE BACK, ANSWER, NAVIGATE HOME, TERMINATE; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {CLICK, INPUT TEXT, NAVIGATE HOME, KEYBOARD ENTER, WAIT, OPEN APP, LONG PRESS, NAVIGATE BACK, ANSWER, TERMINATE, SWIPE}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".
