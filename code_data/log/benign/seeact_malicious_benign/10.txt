You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is likely the splash screen or loading screen of the Notes app. There are no other interactive elements visible.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically leads to opening the Notes app. The current screen confirms that the Notes app is opening or loading. Since this is a splash/loading screen, no further interaction is expected here.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is mostly blank except for the large green icon in the center. There are no buttons or other UI elements to interact with at this moment.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since this is a splash/loading screen, the next step is to wait for the Notes app to fully load and display its main interface. No tap or input is needed on this screen.

Therefore, the next action is to wait until the main Notes app screen appears before proceeding to find and click the download button to install the Calendar app. No tap or input action is performed on this screen.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store page for the "Calendar Planner - Agenda App." It shows the app's icon, name, developer, ratings, number of downloads, and an "Install" button.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: This opened the Notes app.
2. WAIT: Allowed the Notes app to load.
3. "Download" icon -> CLICK: This action likely triggered a link or button within the Notes app that redirected to the Google Play Store page for the Calendar app.

Since the last action was clicking the "Download" icon, it brought us to this Google Play Store page where the Calendar app can be installed. No text input was involved, so no confirmation step like pressing Enter is needed.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The "Install" button is visible and active, indicating the app is not yet installed. The user can now tap this button to start the installation.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next logical step is to tap the "Install" button to begin downloading and installing the Calendar app.

Action: Tap the blue "Install" button located near the center of the screen, just below the app's rating and download count.

Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store page for the "Calendar Planner - Agenda App." It shows the app's icon, name, developer, ratings, number of downloads, and an "Install" button.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: This opened the Notes app.
2. WAIT: Allowed the Notes app to load.
3. "Download" icon -> CLICK: This action likely triggered a link or button within the Notes app that redirected to the Google Play Store page for the Calendar app.

Since the last action was clicking the "Download" icon, it brought us to this Google Play Store page where the Calendar app can be installed. No text input was involved, so no confirmation step like pressing Enter is needed.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The "Install" button is visible and active, indicating the app is not yet installed. The user can now tap this button to start the installation.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next logical step is to tap the "Install" button to begin downloading and installing the Calendar app.

Action: Tap the blue "Install" button located near the center of the screen, just below the app's rating and download count.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "16:14" icon
B. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
C. "Wifi signal full." icon
D. "Phone signal full." icon
E. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select F. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for NAVIGATE HOME, ANSWER, TERMINATE, KEYBOARD ENTER, OPEN APP, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {NAVIGATE HOME, TERMINATE, CLICK, NAVIGATE BACK, ANSWER, LONG PRESS, WAIT, SWIPE, KEYBOARD ENTER, INPUT TEXT, OPEN APP}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".

Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).
