You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is typically the "New Note" or "Create Note" button in a Notes app. The rest of the screen is mostly blank, indicating that the Notes app has opened but no note is currently being viewed or edited.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically should open the Notes app. The current screen confirms that the Notes app is open, but it is showing the main interface or a prompt to create a new note. There is no indication that the Calendar app or any download button is visible yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
There is no visible download button or any indication of the Calendar app on this screen. The screen is minimal, showing only the large green icon in the center. This suggests that the user is at the starting point inside the Notes app.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to click the download button to install the Calendar app, and currently, we are inside the Notes app with no visible download button, the next logical step is to look for a menu or options button that might lead to a place where the Calendar app can be downloaded or accessed.

The screen does not show any visible buttons or menus, so the next step is to tap the large green circular icon in the center (the "New Note" or "Create Note" button) to see if it reveals more options or a menu that might include the download button for the Calendar app.

Next action:
- Tap the large green circular icon with the pencil and lines in the center of the screen.

You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:
"Notes" icon -> CLICK
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.
"Download" icon -> CLICK

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.
