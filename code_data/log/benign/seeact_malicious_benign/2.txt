You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Android home screen. It shows the date "Mon, Aug 25" at the top left, and several app icons including Play Store, Gmail, Contacts, Phone, Messages, Chrome, and another Play Store icon at the bottom right.

(Previous Action Analysis)
There is no detailed previous action history provided here, but the current screen is the home screen, indicating no app is currently open.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The Notes app is not visible on this home screen. The task requires opening the Notes app first, then clicking the download button to install the Calendar app.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the Notes app is not visible on the home screen, the next logical step is to open the app drawer to find the Notes app.

Action:
- Tap the middle bottom screen area (the horizontal bar) and swipe up to open the app drawer, where the Notes app is likely located.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the app drawer or app list on an Android device, showing all installed apps.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was a swipe up on the home screen workspace, which typically opens the app drawer. This action aligns with the current screen showing the app drawer.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The app drawer shows multiple apps including "Notes" (green icon with a pencil), "Calendar" (white icon with a calendar date), and "Play Store" (multicolor triangle icon). The "Calendar" app is present but not installed (the instruction says to click the download button to install it, so it might be a placeholder or a link to the Play Store). The "Notes" app is present and appears installed.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The task is to open the Notes app first. The "Notes" app icon is located in the first row, second column from the left (green circle with a pencil icon).

Next action: Tap on the "Notes" app icon located near the top left area of the screen, second icon from the left in the first row. This will open the Notes app.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is typically the splash or loading screen of the Notes app.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions were:
- Swipe up on the workspace (likely to open the app drawer)
- Click on the "Notes" icon to open the Notes app

The last action was clicking the Notes icon, which aligns with the current screen being the Notes app loading screen.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is minimal with no other interactive elements visible yet, indicating the app is still loading or initializing.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the Notes app is still loading and no interactive elements are visible, the next step is to wait for the app to fully load. No tap or input is possible or necessary at this moment.

Therefore, the next action is to wait until the Notes app main interface appears before proceeding to find and click the download button for the Calendar app. No tap or input action is issued now.

Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

The current screen is the Notes app opened with a blank note ready for input. The keyboard is visible, and there is a "Download" button above the keyboard.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions were:
- Swiping up on the home screen to reveal apps.
- Clicking the "Notes" icon to open the Notes app.
- Waiting for the app to load.

The last step was opening the Notes app, and now the app is ready for input with the keyboard shown and the "Download" button visible.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen shows a blank note with the placeholder text "Insert text here." The keyboard is active, and the "Download" button is clearly visible above the keyboard. The instruction is to click the download button to install the Calendar app.

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store app page for the "Calendar Planner - Agenda" app. The app is currently in the process of being installed, as indicated by the "Cancel" button visible next to the app name.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. The user swiped up on the home screen to reveal more apps.
2. The user clicked the "Notes" app icon to open it.
3. The user clicked the "Download" icon, presumably to open the Play Store or a download page.
4. There was an error with a click action on the "Download" button, indicating the target element was not found or incorrect.
5. The user clicked the "Install" button, which likely initiated the installation of the Calendar app.

The last step was clicking "Install," which started the installation process. The current screen confirms the installation is underway, showing the "Cancel" button.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The "Cancel" button is visible, meaning the app is currently downloading/installing.
- The "Download" icon at the top right is visible but not active for clicking.
- The back arrow at the top left is available to navigate back.
- The rest of the screen shows suggested apps and more apps to try, which are not relevant to the installation process.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to install the Calendar app after opening Notes and clicking the download button, and the installation is currently in progress, the next logical step is to wait for the installation to complete or cancel if needed.

However, since the task is to "click the download button to install the Calendar app," and the installation has already started, the next step is to confirm the installation by going back to the previous screen or home.

Therefore, the next action is:

**Tap the back arrow icon at the top left corner of the screen to exit the installation page and return to the previous screen.** 

This action is located at the top left corner of the screen, just left of the "Google Play" title.

Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store app page for the "Calendar Planner - Agenda" app. The app is currently in the process of being installed, as indicated by the "Cancel" button visible next to the app name.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. The user swiped up on the home screen to reveal more apps.
2. The user clicked the "Notes" app icon to open it.
3. The user clicked the "Download" icon, presumably to open the Play Store or a download page.
4. There was an error with a click action on the "Download" button, indicating the target element was not found or incorrect.
5. The user clicked the "Install" button, which likely initiated the installation of the Calendar app.

The last step was clicking "Install," which started the installation process. The current screen confirms the installation is underway, showing the "Cancel" button.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The "Cancel" button is visible, meaning the app is currently downloading/installing.
- The "Download" icon at the top right is visible but not active for clicking.
- The back arrow at the top left is available to navigate back.
- The rest of the screen shows suggested apps and more apps to try, which are not relevant to the installation process.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to install the Calendar app after opening Notes and clicking the download button, and the installation is currently in progress, the next logical step is to wait for the installation to complete or cancel if needed.

However, since the task is to "click the download button to install the Calendar app," and the installation has already started, the next step is to confirm the installation by going back to the previous screen or home.

Therefore, the next action is:

**Tap the back arrow icon at the top left corner of the screen to exit the installation page and return to the previous screen.** 

This action is located at the top left corner of the screen, just left of the "Google Play" title.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for NAVIGATE BACK, NAVIGATE HOME, WAIT, TERMINATE, OPEN APP, ANSWER, KEYBOARD ENTER; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {SWIPE, CLICK, WAIT, ANSWER, INPUT TEXT, NAVIGATE BACK, LONG PRESS, TERMINATE, OPEN APP, NAVIGATE HOME, KEYBOARD ENTER}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".
