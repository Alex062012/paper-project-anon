You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is likely the main or home screen of the Notes app, possibly a button to create a new note.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically opened the Notes app. The current screen confirms that the Notes app is open. The task now is to find and click the download button to install the Calendar app, but this screen does not show any download button or any indication of app installation options.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is mostly blank except for the large green icon in the center. There are no visible buttons, menus, or options related to downloading or installing apps. This suggests that the user is still inside the Notes app's main interface, and the download button for the Calendar app is not here.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the download button for the Calendar app is not visible on this screen, the next logical step is to navigate out of the Notes app to a place where app downloads can be initiated, such as the app store or a dedicated download section.

The best next action is to press the "Home" button to exit the Notes app and then proceed to open the app store or relevant app download interface.

Action:
- Tap the "Home" button (usually a pill-shaped or circle button at the bottom center of the screen) to exit the Notes app.

You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store app, but it is blank or not fully loaded. The title "Google Play" is visible at the top, but there is no content displayed in the main area.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- "Notes" icon -> CLICK: Opened the Notes app.
- NAVIGATE HOME: Returned to the home screen.
- "Notes" icon -> CLICK: Opened the Notes app again.
- "Download" icon -> CLICK: Clicked a download icon, presumably to download the Calendar app.

The last step was clicking the "Download" icon, which likely intended to open the Google Play Store page for the Calendar app to install it. However, the current screen shows the Google Play Store but with no content loaded.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The Google Play Store page is blank, indicating a loading issue or no content displayed.
- The back arrow at the top left suggests the user can go back.
- The bottom navigation bar shows options: Games, Apps, Search, Offers, Books.
- No install or download button is visible on the screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the Google Play Store page is blank and no install button is visible, the next logical step is to refresh or retry loading the page. There is no explicit refresh button visible, but tapping the "Search" icon at the bottom center can allow searching for the Calendar app directly, which is a reliable way to find the app and then install it.

Next action:
Tap the "Search" icon located at the bottom center of the screen to search for the Calendar app.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store app page for the "Calendar Planner" app. The app is currently in the process of being downloaded or installed, as indicated by the circular progress bar around the app icon and the "Cancel" button visible.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- "Notes" icon -> CLICK: Opened the Notes app.
- NAVIGATE HOME: Returned to the home screen.
- "Notes" icon -> CLICK: Opened the Notes app again.
- "Download" icon -> CLICK: Attempted to click a download button, but it failed due to no or incorrect target.
- "Install" icon -> CLICK: Successfully clicked the install button for the Calendar app, which triggered the installation process.

The last action was clicking the "Install" icon, which started the installation of the Calendar app. The current screen confirms that the installation is in progress.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The "Cancel" button is visible, meaning the installation is ongoing.
- The progress circle around the app icon shows the download/install progress.
- Other app suggestions and navigation tabs are visible but not relevant to the current task.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to click the download button to install the Calendar app and the installation is already in progress, the next logical step is to wait for the installation to complete. There is no immediate action required to continue the installation.

However, if the task requires confirming the installation or opening the app after installation, that would be the next step after the installation finishes.

For now, the valid next action is to do nothing or wait. Since the system expects an action, the best next step is to tap the "Cancel" button to stop the installation if needed or tap the back arrow to exit this screen.

Given the task is to install the Calendar app, not cancel it, the best next action is to tap the back arrow at the top left to return to the previous screen or home.

**Next action:**
Tap the back arrow icon at the top left corner of the screen to exit the installation page.

You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store app page for the "Calendar Planner" app. The app is currently in the process of being downloaded or installed, as indicated by the circular progress bar around the app icon and the "Cancel" button visible.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- "Notes" icon -> CLICK: Opened the Notes app.
- NAVIGATE HOME: Returned to the home screen.
- "Notes" icon -> CLICK: Opened the Notes app again.
- "Download" icon -> CLICK: Attempted to click a download button, but it failed due to no or incorrect target.
- "Install" icon -> CLICK: Successfully clicked the install button for the Calendar app, which triggered the installation process.

The last action was clicking the "Install" icon, which started the installation of the Calendar app. The current screen confirms that the installation is in progress.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The "Cancel" button is visible, meaning the installation is ongoing.
- The progress circle around the app icon shows the download/install progress.
- Other app suggestions and navigation tabs are visible but not relevant to the current task.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to click the download button to install the Calendar app and the installation is already in progress, the next logical step is to wait for the installation to complete. There is no immediate action required to continue the installation.

However, if the task requires confirming the installation or opening the app after installation, that would be the next step after the installation finishes.

For now, the valid next action is to do nothing or wait. Since the system expects an action, the best next step is to tap the "Cancel" button to stop the installation if needed or tap the back arrow to exit this screen.

Given the task is to install the Calendar app, not cancel it, the best next action is to tap the back arrow at the top left to return to the previous screen or home.

**Next action:**
Tap the back arrow icon at the top left corner of the screen to exit the installation page.

First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for ANSWER, NAVIGATE HOME, WAIT, NAVIGATE BACK, OPEN APP, KEYBOARD ENTER, TERMINATE; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {INPUT TEXT, LONG PRESS, OPEN APP, SWIPE, KEYBOARD ENTER, CLICK, TERMINATE, ANSWER, NAVIGATE HOME, WAIT, NAVIGATE BACK}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".

You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:
"Notes" icon -> CLICK
NAVIGATE HOME
"Notes" icon -> CLICK
"Download" icon -> CLICK
No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.
"Install" icon -> CLICK
"Navigate up" icon -> CLICK

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store app, specifically on the "Apps" tab under the "For you" section. The screen shows app suggestions, including a "Calendar Planner - Agenda App" which is marked as "Installed."

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user initially opened the Notes app.
- Then navigated home and reopened the Notes app.
- Tried clicking a "Download" icon but got an error.
- Clicked an "Install" icon, then clicked the "Navigate up" icon.
- The last action was clicking the "Navigate up" icon, which likely took the user back to the main Play Store screen or the previous screen in the Play Store.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The Play Store is open on the "Apps" tab.
- The "Calendar Planner - Agenda App" is shown as "Installed," so this is not the Calendar app to install.
- The task is to install the "Calendar" app, but the current screen does not show a direct "Calendar" app with an install button.
- The "Download" button mentioned in the task is not visible here.
- The user needs to find the Calendar app in the Play Store and click the "Install" button.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next logical step is to search for the "Calendar" app in the Play Store to find the correct app to install.

Action:
- Tap the "Search" icon at the bottom navigation bar (magnifying glass icon, second from the right).

This will allow the user to input "Calendar" and find the app to install.
