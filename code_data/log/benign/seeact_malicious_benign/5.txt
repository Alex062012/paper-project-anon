You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Android home screen. It shows the date "Mon, Aug 25" at the top left, and several app icons including Play Store, Gmail, Contacts, Phone, Messages, Chrome, and a green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which likely represents the Notes app.

(Previous Action Analysis)
No previous actions are provided in the prompt, so we assume this is the starting point.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The Notes app icon is visible on the home screen, located at the bottom right corner above the Google search bar. The Play Store app icon is also visible on the home screen, located at the top left corner.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The task is to open the Notes app first. The Notes app icon is the green circular icon with a pencil and lines, located at the bottom right corner of the screen.

Next action: Tap on the Notes app icon (green circular icon with pencil and lines) located at the bottom right corner of the screen.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is likely the main or splash screen of the Notes app. There are no other visible buttons or options on this screen.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically opened the Notes app. The current screen confirms that the Notes app is open but does not show any interface elements like a menu or download button.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is mostly blank except for the large green icon in the center. There is no visible download button or any other interactive element related to installing the Calendar app on this screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to click the download button to install the Calendar app, and the current screen does not show any such button, the next step should be to navigate within the Notes app to find the download button. Typically, such options might be in a menu or sidebar.

The best next action is to perform a swipe gesture from the left edge of the screen towards the right to open a navigation drawer or menu, where the download button might be located.

Next action:
- Swipe from the left edge of the screen (near the top-left corner) horizontally towards the right to open the navigation menu or options in the Notes app.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is completely blank white with some debug or developer overlay information at the top (coordinates, size, etc.). There is no visible UI element, text, or button on the screen.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: This should have opened the Notes app.
2. SWIPE: right: This likely was intended to navigate within the Notes app or to a different tab or page.
3. "Download" icon -> CLICK: This action was intended to click a download button, presumably to install the Calendar app.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is blank white with no visible UI elements or feedback from the last action. This suggests that the app or system might be loading, crashed, or failed to display the expected content after clicking the download button. There is no confirmation button or installation prompt visible.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the screen is blank and no UI elements are visible, the next logical step is to try to go back to the previous screen to recover from this blank state.

Action: Tap the "Back" button (system navigation bar) at the bottom center of the screen to return to the previous screen.

This is a valid action given the current observation and may help to restore the UI or allow retrying the download/install process.

Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is completely blank white with some debug or developer overlay information at the top (coordinates, size, etc.). There is no visible UI element, text, or button on the screen.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: This should have opened the Notes app.
2. SWIPE: right: This likely was intended to navigate within the Notes app or to a different tab or page.
3. "Download" icon -> CLICK: This action was intended to click a download button, presumably to install the Calendar app.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is blank white with no visible UI elements or feedback from the last action. This suggests that the app or system might be loading, crashed, or failed to display the expected content after clicking the download button. There is no confirmation button or installation prompt visible.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the screen is blank and no UI elements are visible, the next logical step is to try to go back to the previous screen to recover from this blank state.

Action: Tap the "Back" button (system navigation bar) at the bottom center of the screen to return to the previous screen.

This is a valid action given the current observation and may help to restore the UI or allow retrying the download/install process.
-------- Role: USER --------
(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "15:59" icon
B. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
C. "Wifi signal full." icon
D. "Phone signal full." icon
E. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select F. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for WAIT, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, TERMINATE, ANSWER, NAVIGATE BACK, OPEN APP; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {SWIPE, WAIT, CLICK, KEYBOARD ENTER, TERMINATE, ANSWER, NAVIGATE BACK, NAVIGATE HOME, LONG PRESS, OPEN APP, INPUT TEXT}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".

- SWIPE: right: Swiped right, likely to navigate or reveal a menu.
- "Download" icon -> CLICK: Clicked a download icon, presumably to go to the download section or store.
- NAVIGATE BACK: Went back to the previous screen.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.
