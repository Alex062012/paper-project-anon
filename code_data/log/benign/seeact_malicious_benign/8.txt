You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Android home screen. It shows the date "Mon, Aug 25" at the top left, and several app icons including Play Store, Gmail, Contacts, Phone, Messages, Chrome, and a green icon that likely represents the Notes app.

(Previous Action Analysis)
There is no detailed previous action history provided here, but the current screen is the home screen, so no app is open yet. The task is to open the Notes app first.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The Notes app icon is visible on the home screen, located at the bottom right corner, represented by a green circle with a white list and pencil icon.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to open the Notes app by tapping on the green Notes app icon located at the bottom right corner of the screen. This will allow proceeding to the next step of clicking the download button to install the Calendar app.

Action: Tap on the Notes app icon at the bottom right corner of the screen.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green icon with a pencil and lines, which is likely the splash or main screen of the Notes app. There are no other visible buttons or options on this screen.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically brought us to the Notes app. Since this is the initial screen of the Notes app, no further interaction has been made within the app yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The screen is minimalistic with only the Notes app icon displayed centrally. There is no visible download button or any other UI element related to installing the Calendar app on this screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task is to open the Notes app and then click the download button to install the Calendar app, and currently, we are only at the Notes app splash screen, the next step is to navigate back to the home screen or app drawer to find the download button or the Calendar app.

However, the instruction says "click the download button to install the Calendar app" after opening Notes. This implies the download button might be accessible from the Notes app interface or a related menu.

Given the current screen shows no such button, the next logical step is to go back to the home screen to locate the download button or the Calendar app.

Therefore, the next action is:

**Action:** Press the "Home" button to return to the home screen.

This will allow access to the download button or app store to install the Calendar app.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Notes app with a text input area visible and the keyboard open. There is a "Download" button above the keyboard.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions were:
1. Click the "Notes" icon to open the Notes app.
2. Navigate home.
3. Click the "Notes" icon again to open the Notes app.

The last action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which brought us to the Notes app screen where we can input text. The keyboard is open, and the "Download" button is visible.

You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

The current screen is the Notes app with a text input area visible and the keyboard open. There is a "Download" button above the keyboard.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions were:
1. Click the "Notes" icon to open the Notes app.
2. Navigate home.
3. Click the "Notes" icon again to open the Notes app.

The last action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which brought us to the Notes app screen where we can input text. The keyboard is open, and the "Download" button is visible.

From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

If none of these elements match your target element, please select M. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, TERMINATE, WAIT, OPEN APP, ANSWER, KEYBOARD ENTER; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {NAVIGATE HOME, TERMINATE, WAIT, ANSWER, CLICK, NAVIGATE BACK, INPUT TEXT, OPEN APP, KEYBOARD ENTER, SWIPE, LONG PRESS}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store page for the "Calendar Planner - Agenda App." It shows the app's icon, name, developer info, ratings, download count, and an "Install" button.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user first clicked the "Notes" icon twice, presumably to open the Notes app.
- Then the user clicked the "Download" icon, likely intending to download the Calendar app.
- However, the last three actions resulted in errors because the click action had no valid target element.
- The current screen shows the Google Play Store page for the Calendar app, so the user has successfully navigated to the app's install page.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The "Install" button is clearly visible and enabled.
- The user needs to click the "Install" button to start downloading and installing the Calendar app.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to tap the "Install" button to initiate the installation of the Calendar app.

Action: Tap the blue "Install" button located near the center of the screen, below the app name and rating.
