You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green icon with a pencil and lines, which is likely the splash or loading screen of the Notes app. There are no other interactive elements visible.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which logically leads to opening the Notes app. The current screen confirms that the Notes app is in the process of opening or loading.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
No buttons or interactive elements are visible yet, indicating the app is still loading or initializing.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the app is still loading and no interactive elements are available, the next step is to wait for the app to fully load. No tap or input action is possible or necessary at this moment.

Therefore, the next action is to wait until the Notes app finishes loading and displays its main interface where the download button for the Calendar app might be accessible. No tap or input action is performed now.

The current screen is the Google Play Store page for the "Calendar Planner - Agenda App." It shows the app's icon, name, developer, rating, number of downloads, and an "Install" button.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: This opened the Notes app.
2. WAIT: Waited for the Notes app to load.
3. "Download" icon -> CLICK: This likely triggered a link or button within the Notes app to open the Google Play Store page for the Calendar app.

The last action brought us to the Google Play Store page for the Calendar app, where the next logical step is to install the app.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The "Install" button is visible and active in the center of the screen, indicating the app is not yet installed. No other pop-ups or dialogs are present.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to tap the "Install" button to start downloading and installing the Calendar app.

Action: Tap the blue "Install" button located near the center of the screen, below the app name and rating.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "16:01" icon
B. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
C. "Wifi signal full." icon
D. "Phone signal full." icon
E. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select F. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for OPEN APP, NAVIGATE HOME, KEYBOARD ENTER, TERMINATE, ANSWER, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {OPEN APP, NAVIGATE HOME, INPUT TEXT, TERMINATE, KEYBOARD ENTER, SWIPE, CLICK, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, ANSWER, LONG PRESS}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".

No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store page for the "Calendar Planner - Agenda App." It shows the app details, including the app icon, name, developer, ratings, downloads, and an "Install" button.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The first action was clicking the "Notes" icon, presumably to open the Notes app.
- The second action was clicking the "Download" icon, likely intending to download the Calendar app.
- The error message indicates that the last click action on the "Download" icon failed because the target element was incorrect or missing.
- The current screen shows the Google Play Store page for the Calendar app, meaning the previous action successfully navigated to the app's page but did not successfully click the install/download button.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The "Install" button is clearly visible in the middle of the screen, colored blue.
- The "Download" icon mentioned previously is not visible here; instead, the correct action to install the app is to click the "Install" button.
- The bottom navigation bar shows options like Games, Apps, Search, Offers, and Books, but these are unrelated to the current task.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to click the blue "Install" button located centrally below the app name and rating section to start downloading and installing the Calendar app.

Action:
- Tap the blue "Install" button in the center of the screen, just below the app rating and download count.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store app page for the "Calendar Planner" app. The app is in the process of being downloaded or installed, as indicated by the circular progress indicator around the app icon and the "Cancel" button visible.

(Previous Action Analysis)
1. "Notes" icon -> CLICK: The user opened the Notes app.
2. "Download" icon -> CLICK: The user attempted to click a download button, but it failed due to no or incorrect target.
3. "Install" icon -> CLICK: The user clicked the install button, which likely initiated the download/install process for the Calendar app.

The last action was clicking "Install," which triggered the current download process visible on the screen.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The app "Calendar Planner" is currently downloading or installing.
- The "Cancel" button is visible, meaning the installation is in progress.
- There is no "Open" button yet, so the app is not fully installed.
- The user wants to install the Calendar app, and the installation is underway.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the installation is in progress, the next logical step is to wait for the installation to complete. There is no immediate action required or available to speed up the process. The "Cancel" button is present if the user wants to stop the installation, but the task is to install the app, so canceling is not appropriate.

Therefore, the next action is to wait until the installation finishes and the "Open" button appears.

Action: WAIT (no tap or input action now)
