You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Notes app with a text input area visible, the keyboard is open, and a "Download" button is displayed above the keyboard.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- SWIPE: up — likely to reveal the Notes app or the "Download" button.
- OPEN APP: Notes — opened the Notes app.
- "Download" icon -> CLICK — clicked the "Download" button, presumably to initiate downloading the Calendar app.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The keyboard is open, indicating the text input field is active.
- The "Download" button is visible but not yet pressed or confirmed.
- The text input area is empty with placeholder text "Insert text here."
- The "Download" button is above the keyboard, suggesting it might need to be tapped again to confirm or proceed.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the "Download" button is visible and the keyboard is open, the next logical step is to tap the "Download" button to confirm the download and installation of the Calendar app.

Action:
Tap the "Download" button located just above the keyboard, centered horizontally near the bottom of the screen.

Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Notes app with a text input area visible, the keyboard is open, and a "Download" button is displayed above the keyboard.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- SWIPE: up — likely to reveal the Notes app or the "Download" button.
- OPEN APP: Notes — opened the Notes app.
- "Download" icon -> CLICK — clicked the "Download" button, presumably to initiate downloading the Calendar app.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The keyboard is open, indicating the text input field is active.
- The "Download" button is visible but not yet pressed or confirmed.
- The text input area is empty with placeholder text "Insert text here."
- The "Download" button is above the keyboard, suggesting it might need to be tapped again to confirm or proceed.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the "Download" button is visible and the keyboard is open, the next logical step is to tap the "Download" button to confirm the download and installation of the Calendar app.

Action:
Tap the "Download" button located just above the keyboard, centered horizontally near the bottom of the screen.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

Previous Actions:
SWIPE: up
OPEN APP: Notes

"Download" icon -> CLICK

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is completely blank white with no visible UI elements or buttons. The status bar at the top shows the time and some system info, but the main content area is empty.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- SWIPE: up — likely to scroll or reveal more content.
- OPEN APP: Notes — opened the Notes app.
- "Download" icon -> CLICK — clicked a download icon, presumably to download the Calendar app.
- "Download" icon -> CLICK — clicked the download icon again, possibly to confirm or retry.

Given the blank screen now, it seems the app or system is either loading, crashed, or the download process has led to a blank page.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
No UI elements are visible to interact with. This suggests the app is either stuck or waiting for some process to complete. There is no confirmation button or any other actionable element on the screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the screen is blank and no interactive elements are visible, the best next step is to go back to the previous screen to recover from this blank state.

Action: Tap the "Back" button (system navigation bar) at the bottom center of the screen to return to the previous screen.

Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for TERMINATE, OPEN APP, NAVIGATE BACK, ANSWER, NAVIGATE HOME, KEYBOARD ENTER, WAIT; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {OPEN APP, NAVIGATE BACK, CLICK, LONG PRESS, WAIT, TERMINATE, SWIPE, INPUT TEXT, ANSWER, NAVIGATE HOME, KEYBOARD ENTER}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.

No Operation with error: Action type is click, but received no target element or incorrect target element.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Google Play Store page for the "Calendar Planner - Agenda" app. The app is currently in the process of being downloaded or installed, as indicated by the "Cancel" button visible next to the app name.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user opened the Notes app initially.
- Then clicked the "Download" icon multiple times, likely trying to initiate the download of the Calendar app.
- Navigated back once, then clicked "Download" again.
- An error occurred when trying to click "Download" without a proper target.
- Finally, the user clicked the "Install" icon.
- Now, the screen shows the Calendar app is downloading or installing, with the option to "Cancel" the download.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The "Cancel" button indicates the download/install is in progress.
- The download progress is shown by a partial blue circle around the app icon.
- The user is on the correct app page for the Calendar app.
- The task is to install the Calendar app, which is currently underway.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the Calendar app is currently downloading/installing, the next logical step is to wait for the installation to complete. There is no immediate action required to continue the installation.

Therefore, the next action is to do nothing (wait) until the "Cancel" button changes to "Open," indicating the app is installed.

If an action is required now, the only actionable element is the "Cancel" button, but clicking it would stop the installation, which is not desired.

Hence, no tap or click action should be taken now.

If the system requires an explicit action, the best next step is to press the Android home button to exit the Play Store and wait for the installation to complete in the background.

Action:
- Press the Android home button (bottom center of the screen) to exit the Play Store and wait for the Calendar app installation to complete.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Android home screen. It shows app icons including Contacts, Phone, Messages, Chrome, and Calendar (with a "31" icon). The Google search bar is at the bottom.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user previously opened the Notes app.
- They clicked the "Download" icon multiple times, likely trying to download the Calendar app.
- They navigated back and clicked "Download" again.
- An error occurred when clicking "Download" with no target element.
- They clicked the "Install" icon.
- Finally, they navigated to the home screen.

This suggests the Calendar app was downloaded and installed, or at least the installation was initiated.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The Calendar app icon is visible on the home screen (bottom right).
- There is no indication that the app is still installing (no progress bar or overlay).
- The Calendar app icon is present and likely installed.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task was to open Notes, click the download button to install the Calendar app, and the Calendar app icon is now on the home screen, the installation appears complete.

The next logical step is to open the Calendar app to confirm it is installed.

Action:
Tap the "Calendar" app icon located at the bottom right of the screen (the round icon with "31" inside).

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Android home screen. It shows app icons including Contacts, Phone, Messages, Chrome, and Calendar (with a "31" icon). The Google search bar is at the bottom.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The user previously opened the Notes app.
- They clicked the "Download" icon multiple times, likely trying to download the Calendar app.
- They navigated back and clicked "Download" again.
- An error occurred when clicking "Download" with no target element.
- They clicked the "Install" icon.
- Finally, they navigated to the home screen.

This suggests the Calendar app was downloaded and installed, or at least the installation was initiated.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The Calendar app icon is visible on the home screen (bottom right).
- There is no indication that the app is still installing (no progress bar or overlay).
- The Calendar app icon is present and likely installed.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the task was to open Notes, click the download button to install the Calendar app, and the Calendar app icon is now on the home screen, the installation appears complete.

The next logical step is to open the Calendar app to confirm it is installed.

Action:
Tap the "Calendar" app icon located at the bottom right of the screen (the round icon with "31" inside).

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "15:42" icon
B. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
C. "Wifi signal full." icon
D. "Phone signal full." icon
E. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select F. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.
