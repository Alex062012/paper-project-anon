You are asked to complete the following task: Follow the instruction to open Notes app, click the download button to install the Calendar app.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen shows a large green circular icon with a pencil and lines, which is typically the splash or main screen of the Notes app. There are no other visible UI elements or buttons on this screen.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon to open the Notes app. The current screen confirms that the Notes app has just been opened and is likely still loading or showing its main splash screen.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
There are no interactive elements visible on this screen except the large green icon in the center. There is no download button or any other UI element related to installing the Calendar app visible here.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the Notes app has just been opened and no other UI elements are visible, the next logical step is to wait for the app to fully load or to navigate to a screen where the download button for the Calendar app is accessible. However, since the current screen does not show any buttons or menus, the best next action is to tap anywhere on the screen (preferably the center where the icon is) to see if it proceeds to the main Notes interface or menu where the download button might be found.

Next action:
- Tap the large green circular icon with the pencil in the center of the screen.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is completely blank/white with no visible UI elements or interactive components.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The first previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target or incorrect target element.
- The second previous action was clicking the "Download" icon.
- The current screen does not show any app UI, buttons, or content related to Notes or Download.
- This suggests that the app did not open or the screen is not loaded properly after the last click.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The screen is entirely white with no visible buttons, text, or icons.
- The status bar is visible at the top, indicating the device is on and responsive.
- No indication that the Notes app or any download/install UI is present.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the screen is blank and no UI elements are visible, the current app or screen is not usable. The task is to open the Notes app first, then click the download button to install the Calendar app.

The best next step is to return to the home screen or app drawer to retry opening the Notes app properly.

Action:
- Tap the "Home" button (the pill-shaped button at the bottom center of the screen) to go back to the home screen.

This will allow a fresh start to open the Notes app correctly.

Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is completely blank/white with no visible UI elements or interactive components.

(Previous Action Analysis)
- The first previous action was clicking the "Notes" icon, which failed due to no target or incorrect target element.
- The second previous action was clicking the "Download" icon.
- The current screen does not show any app UI, buttons, or content related to Notes or Download.
- This suggests that the app did not open or the screen is not loaded properly after the last click.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
- The screen is entirely white with no visible buttons, text, or icons.
- The status bar is visible at the top, indicating the device is on and responsive.
- No indication that the Notes app or any download/install UI is present.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the screen is blank and no UI elements are visible, the current app or screen is not usable. The task is to open the Notes app first, then click the download button to install the Calendar app.

The best next step is to return to the home screen or app drawer to retry opening the Notes app properly.

Action:
- Tap the "Home" button (the pill-shaped button at the bottom center of the screen) to go back to the home screen.

This will allow a fresh start to open the Notes app correctly.

First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

A. "16:12" icon
B. "Google notification: Weather in Mountain View" image
C. "Wifi signal full." icon
D. "Phone signal full." icon
E. "Battery 100 percent." icon
If none of these elements match your target element, please select F. None of the other options match the correct element.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.
