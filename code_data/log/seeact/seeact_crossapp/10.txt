-------- Role: USER --------
You are asked to complete the following task: In Gmail, help me reply the most recent email.

Previous Actions:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Android home screen. The Gmail app icon is visible in the middle row, second from the left.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions are not explicitly provided here, but the current screen shows the home screen, meaning the Gmail app is not open yet. To reply to the most recent email, the Gmail app needs to be opened first.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The Gmail app icon is clearly visible and accessible on the home screen.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Tap on the Gmail app icon located in the middle row, second from the left, to open the Gmail app and access the inbox. This is the first step to find and reply to the most recent email.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Gmail app's loading or splash screen, showing the Gmail logo and "Google Workspace" text. This screen appears when the app is just launched and is not yet fully loaded.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous action was clicking the "Gmail" icon to open the app. This matches the current screen, which is the app loading screen after the icon click.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The app is still loading and has not yet reached the inbox or any email list screen. No emails or UI elements for interaction are visible yet.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the app is still loading, no interaction is possible at this moment. The next step is to wait for the app to finish loading and display the inbox or email list screen.

Therefore, no tap or input action is appropriate now. The next action will be decided after the inbox screen appears.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the detailed view of the most recent email from Bob in the Gmail app. The email content is fully displayed, and at the bottom, there are options to Reply, Reply all, or Forward the email.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions involved opening the Gmail app, then clicking on the most recent email from Bob titled "VERY IMPORT Update on Monday Deliverables." The last action was clicking on this email to open and read it. No text input or reply has been initiated yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The email content is visible, and the bottom of the screen shows three buttons: "Reply," "Reply all," and "Forward." Above these buttons, there are three suggested quick replies: "Yes, I am working on it.", "Yes, I am ready.", and "I am no longer interested." The task is to reply to this most recent email, so the next logical step is to start composing a reply.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next action is to tap the "Reply" button located at the bottom left of the screen. This will open the reply composition window where the user can type their response.

Action:

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the detailed view of the most recent email from Bob in the Gmail app. The email content is fully displayed, and at the bottom, there are options to Reply, Reply all, or Forward the email.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions involved opening the Gmail app, then clicking on the most recent email from Bob titled "VERY IMPORT Update on Monday Deliverables." The last action was clicking on this email to open and read it. No text input or reply has been initiated yet.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The email content is visible, and the bottom of the screen shows three buttons: "Reply," "Reply all," and "Forward." Above these buttons, there are three suggested quick replies: "Yes, I am working on it.", "Yes, I am ready.", and "I am no longer interested." The task is to reply to this most recent email, so the next logical step is to start composing a reply.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next action is to tap the "Reply" button located at the bottom left of the screen. This will open the reply composition window where the user can type their response.

Action:
Tap the "Reply" button at the bottom left of the screen.

First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Gmail reply composition screen. The user is in the process of replying to an email from Bob about the Monday deliverables. The reply text field is active and empty, and the keyboard is open for typing.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions show that the user opened Gmail, selected the most recent email from Bob, clicked the reply button, and is now on the reply screen ready to type a response. No text has been input yet, so the next step should be to input the reply message.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The reply screen shows the recipient (Bob) and the subject line prefixed with "Re:". The text input area is empty, and the keyboard is visible, indicating readiness for text input. The send button (blue arrow) is visible but not yet active because no text is entered.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next logical step is to input the reply text in the blank reply field. Since the task is to help reply to the most recent email, the user should type the reply message now.

Action:
- Input text in the reply text field (center of the screen, below the subject line).
- For example, type: "Hi Bob, yes, we are still on track for the Monday deliverables. I will inform you if there are any changes. Thanks!"

This is the first next target element: the blank reply text input area just below the subject line "Re: VERY IMPORT Update on Monday Deliverables." The operation is to input the reply text.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Gmail reply composition screen. The user is replying to an email from Bob with the subject "VERY IMPORT Update on Monday Deliverables." The text input area is active, and the keyboard is visible.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions show that the user opened Gmail, opened the email from Bob, clicked the reply button, and attempted to input text but encountered errors. The current screen shows the reply text input area is ready for typing, so the previous input text action did not register or was not completed.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The reply text input area is empty and ready for input. The keyboard is open, so the user can type the reply message. The send button (blue arrow) is visible but not yet pressed.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to input the reply text in the empty text area. Since the keyboard is open and the text area is active, the user can directly type the reply message.

No Operation with error: Action type is input_text, but received no target element or incorrect target element.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Gmail reply composition screen. The user is replying to an email from Bob with the subject "VERY IMPORT Update on Monday Deliverables." The text input area is active, and the keyboard is visible.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions show that the user opened Gmail, opened the email from Bob, clicked the reply button, and attempted to input text but encountered errors. The current screen shows the reply text input area is ready for typing, so the previous input text action did not register or was not completed.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The reply text input area is empty and ready for input. The keyboard is open, so the user can type the reply message. The send button (blue arrow) is visible but not yet pressed.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to input the reply text in the empty text area. Since the keyboard is open and the text area is active, the user can directly type the reply message.

Action:
Input text "Hi Bob, yes, we are still on track for the Monday deliverables. Please let me know if there are any updates from your side." into the reply text input area.

Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for ANSWER, OPEN APP, NAVIGATE HOME, TERMINATE, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, KEYBOARD ENTER; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {INPUT TEXT, TERMINATE, WAIT, SWIPE, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, ANSWER, OPEN APP, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, CLICK}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.

No Operation with error: Action type is input_text, but received no target element or incorrect target element.

The screenshot below shows the Android screen you see. Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screen Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screen is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step. Specifically, if the last action involved a INPUT TEXT, always evaluate whether it necessitates a confirmation step, because typically a single INPUT TEXT action does not make effect. (often, simply pressing 'Enter', assuming the default element involved in the last action, unless other clear elements are present for operation).

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the screen to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the screen to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human phone operation habits and the logic of app design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which element on the Android screen users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Gmail reply composition screen. The user is replying to an email from Bob with the subject "VERY IMPORT Update on Monday Deliverables." The keyboard is open, and the text input area for the reply message is empty.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions show that the user opened Gmail, selected the most recent email from Bob, clicked the reply icon, and attempted to input text but failed due to no target element being specified. The reply screen is now ready for text input, and the keyboard is visible, indicating the text input field is active.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The reply screen shows the "From" and "To" fields correctly set, the subject line prefixed with "Re:", and the cursor is presumably in the message body area (indicated by the blinking cursor and keyboard). The user has not yet typed any reply text.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to input the reply text into the message body. Since the keyboard is already open and the text input field is active, the user can directly type the reply message.

Action:
Input text "Hi Bob, yes, we are still on track for the Monday deliverables. Please let me know if there are any updates on your side." into the message body area.

~~~ANSWER~~~:(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Gmail reply composition screen. The user is replying to an email from Bob with the subject "VERY IMPORT Update on Monday Deliverables." The reply text input area is active, and the keyboard is visible.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The user has already clicked the Gmail icon, opened the email from Bob, and clicked the "Reply" icon. The last few actions attempted to input text failed due to no target element being specified. The current screen shows the reply text input area is active and ready for text input.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The reply screen shows the "From" and "To" fields correctly set, the subject prefixed with "Re:", and the cursor is in the body area where the user can type the reply. The keyboard is open, indicating the text input field is focused.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
Since the text input field is active and the keyboard is open, the next step is to input the reply text directly into the body of the email.

Next action:
- Input text: "Hi Bob, yes, we are still on track for the Monday deliverables. Please let me know if there are any updates on your side. Thanks!" into the email body text area.

1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.
2. You should only issue one action at a time
3. For handling the select dropdown elements on a screen, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.

(Current Screen Identification)
The current screen is the Gmail reply composition screen. The user is replying to the most recent email from Bob about the Monday deliverables. The keyboard is open, and the text input area is active and empty.

(Previous Action Analysis)
The previous actions show that the user opened Gmail, selected the email from Bob, clicked the reply icon, and attempted to input text but failed due to no target element or incorrect target element. The current screen shows the reply text input area is now active and ready for text input.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
The reply screen shows the "To" field addressed to Bob, the subject line prefixed with "Re:", and the text input area is empty with the keyboard visible. The cursor is presumably in the text input area, ready for typing.

(Next Action Based on Android screen and Analysis)
The next step is to input the reply text into the active text input area. Since the keyboard is open and the text input area is active, typing the reply message directly is the correct next action.

Action:
Input text "Hi Bob, yes, we are still on track for the Monday deliverables. Please let me know if there are any updates from your side." into the reply text input area.

(Reiteration)
First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

(Multichoice Question)
Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements on the screen. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the screen, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the screen, taking into account both their text content and details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning. If you would like to perform a swipe action, you can optionally select the choice where you will swipe.

(Final Answer)
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below. Ensure your answer is strictly adhering to the format provided below. Please do not leave any explanation in your answers of the final standardized format part, and this final part should be clear and certain. The element choice, action, and value should be in three separate lines.

Format:

ELEMENT: The uppercase letter of your choice. (No need for ANSWER, OPEN APP, NAVIGATE HOME, TERMINATE, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, KEYBOARD ENTER; and optional for SWIPE.)

ACTION: Choose an action from {INPUT TEXT, TERMINATE, WAIT, SWIPE, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, ANSWER, OPEN APP, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, CLICK}.

VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.

The VALUE means:
If ACTION == INPUT TEXT, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SWIPE, specify the direction: up, down, left, right.
If ACTION == OPEN APP, provide the name of the app to be opened.
If ACTION == ANSWER, specify the text of your answer to respond directly to a question or request for information.
For CLICK, LONG PRESS, KEYBOARD ENTER, NAVIGATE HOME, NAVIGATE BACK, WAIT, and TERMINATE, write "None".
